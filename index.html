            <h3>From Overwhelmed to In Control – in Just 5 Minutes</h3>
            <p>Every evening, Irene felt buried by life: work tasks, fitness plans, courses, her kid's activities — all scribbled in her notebook, most undone.</p>
            <p>Everything changed when she tried <strong>SmartGoal</strong>. She entered one sentence:</p>
            <p>"Pass the UX design certification in 3 months."</p>
            <p>The AI broke it into small, daily steps, adjusted them based on her progress, and kept her on track.</p>
            <p>Three months later, she got certified — and still had time to read with her kid every night.</p>
            <p>She said, <em>"For the first time, I'm not being dragged by life — I'm the one steering."</em></p>

            <h2>A Note from the Founder</h2>
            <h3>From Burnout to MVP – The Day SmartGoal Was Born</h3>
            <p>I'm an engineer. I'm also a dad.</p>
            <p>Back then, life felt like a series of fires to put out. I had dreams, but they just sat in my to-do list — untouched.</p>
            <p>Then one day, my wife asked, <em>"You're working so hard every day… why does it feel like you're not getting anywhere?"</em></p>
            <p>That night, I started building a tool to break down my goals.</p>
            <p>To my surprise, AI could do more than just split tasks — it adapted to my energy, my pace, even my mood.</p>
            <p>That prototype became <strong>SmartGoal</strong>.</p>
            <p>It's not just another productivity app — it's a system that helps people turn their dreams into <em>daily doable steps</em>.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
            <h3>A Goal Shouldn't Be a KPI — It Should Be Who You Want to Become</h3>
            <p>We've seen this pattern:</p>
            <p>Most people set goals because their boss said so, or social media said it's what winners do.</p>
            <p>But goals that <em>last</em> come from within —</p>
            <p>Whether it's losing weight to feel healthy again, finishing a portfolio to change careers, or reading to your child every night.</p>
            <p>SmartGoal exists to honor those personal, honest goals — and to help you take one small step toward them each day.</p>
            <p>Because we believe that tiny, meaningful steps are the true drivers of lasting change.</p>
